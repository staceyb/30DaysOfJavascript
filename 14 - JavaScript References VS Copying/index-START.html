    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);

    age = 150;
    console.log(age, age2);

    //Strings
    let name = "Stacey";
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);

    name = "Anastasia";
    console.log(name, name2);
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);
      // You might think we can just do something like this:
    //team[3] = 'Lux';
    //console.log(players, team);
    

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    console.log('Team2 ', team2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log('Team3 ', team3);

    team[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log('Team ', team);
    console.log('Team2 ', team2);
    console.log('Team3 ', team3);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const team4 = [...players];
    console.log('Team 4', team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    console.log('Team 5', team5);
  
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
    console.log(person);
    // and think we make a copy:
    //does not work - as it changes original
    const captian = person;
    captian.age = 50;
    console.log(person)

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 12, nummber: 99 });
    console.log("cap2 ", cap2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    console.log("cap3 ", cap3);
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

//Want to find a deep clone function instead like in lodash
    const wes = {
        name: 'Wes',
        age: 100,
        social: {
          twitter: '@wesbos',
          facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
        }
      };

      console.clear();
      console.log(wes);

      const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);


//poor man's deep clone - not recommended
      const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
